This is a place for me (Jared Roesch) to document my attempts at
bringing "high minded"[^1] ideas in Computer Science into practice.
To me a "high minded" idea is one that provides a strong opinionated
solution to a problem without fine print.

My goal is to eventually host some collaborative writing, and have
others share their attempt at solving problems with "high minded"
solutions.

For the time being this will mostly take the form of me
blogging about my research, programming patterns, and occasional ranting.

[^1]: high minded - "having strong moral principles"
